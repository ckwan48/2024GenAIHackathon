# 2024GenAIHackathon
For 2024 Data+AI's GenAI Hackathon.

We wanted to democratize and modernize medical research that doctors use to diagnose patients. Many medical statistics are limited in demographic scope and a tool that can use varied demographic data will be extremely useful to doctors. For example, "A woman is a man's body with boobs" was a long held belief of the medical profession. Additionally, many skin ailment references did not use a diverse enough sample. We wanted the chatbot we created to provide key insights into health concerns based on various demographics including age, gender, race, and location. The John Snow Research center among other medical bodies have been releasing much more diverse datasets with more comprehensive data on race, gender, age. It will take time for these datasets to be analyzed and make their way into helpful resources/textbooks for the medical community. We are hoping that this chatbot can help surface the more comprehensive statistics to doctors to help diagnose patients earlier than the symptoms present themselves. Early identification of health issues are easier to treat and support a longer life.
